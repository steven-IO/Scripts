#Scripts

This is a handful of scripts that I find useful.

##battery\_check.sh

This is run by a cron every once and awhile (maybe 10 minutes) and if it is below 20% then it sends out a notification.

##BatteryStatus.sh

Sends a notification when run about the battery power level.

##TimeDisplay.sh

Sends a notification that gives the time when run.
